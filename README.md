# Emotion_detection

The detection of emotions in textual data is critical for applications such as mental health monitoring, digital content moderation, and consumer behavior analysis.Traditional methods like Support Vector Machines and Na√Øve Bayes, and other
classical machine learning algorithms, while foundational, often fall short in capturing the full spectrum of human emotions due to their limitations in contextual understanding. This study introduces the use of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers), a encoder transformer that utilizes masked language modeling and next-sentence prediction, to enhance emotion detection capabilities in text. 


Our methodology follows a structured process, starting from data collection and prepossessing to modeling with both traditional algorithms and BERT and culminating in a comprehensive evaluation of model performance. 
Preliminary results indicate that BERT significantly outperforms baseline models, offering a promising avenue for more nuanced and accurate emotion analysis in textual data. This research not only advances the technical understanding of emotion detection but also proposes practical implications for improving human-machine interactions.
